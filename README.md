# Sports poll

The _"Sports Poll"_ app is a dead simple poll system around some sports events

It allows users to vote on each event and then shows another random event to vote on. There should be one poll, that displays one (random) category at a time. E.g. load Football category with poll options to vote on from DB, and only display those at a time, next browser reload would maybe display Tennis.

The polling options should be what team will win or if it will be a draw, e.g.

‚óè Home Team win (Team A)

‚óè Draw

‚óè Away Team win (Team B)
